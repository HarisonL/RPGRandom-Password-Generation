# Developer Launch Notes

In these developer notes we will go over the launching of the randomized password generator.

For our password generator the development team was tasked for create an accurate form in which will generate a secure 8 to 128 character password that consists of upper and lower case letters, numbers, as well as special characters based on user input.

Our goal with this project was consistency as we did not want there to be any reason for frustration on the users end.

The password will prompt the user before completing any generation and will not create the same sequence twice(lest the user be quite lucky of course).

Any and all criticism's are welcome and we know this launch will go over smoothly for those looking to keep their accounts safe and secure. 

Please note that passwords are not saaved on any database for the users sake, generate and use these passwords at ones on discretion.
